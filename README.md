# Puuhamaailma website

This repository contains the archived website codebase for our shut-down Minecraft server project, Puuhamaailma. The site was a static, server-side rendered app, built with Bootstrap 5. Our plan was to build a Node.js-based backend for the site, but the project never began due to the server being shut down.
